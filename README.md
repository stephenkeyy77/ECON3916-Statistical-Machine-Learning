# 📊 Economic Data Science Portfolio

Welcome to my repository for **ECON 3916: Statistical & Machine Learning for Economics**. This portfolio showcases my journey in bridging traditional economic theory with modern data science techniques—a skillset I'm developing to pursue opportunities in finance, particularly in asset management and equity research.

## 👤 About Me

I'm an undergraduate economics student passionate about applying quantitative methods to real-world financial problems. I believe the future of economic analysis lies at the intersection of rigorous causal inference and powerful predictive analytics. Through this coursework, I'm building the technical foundation to transform economic insights into data-driven investment strategies.

## 📚 About This Portfolio

This repository contains my coursework, labs, and projects from ECON 3916, where I'm learning to:

- **Extend foundational concepts**: Starting with classical statistical methods (like OLS regression) and scaling them up using machine learning algorithms (like Lasso, Ridge, and Random Forests)
- **Balance prediction and causation**: Understanding when to prioritize predictive accuracy versus causal interpretation—a critical distinction in economic research and financial decision-making
- **Apply theory to practice**: Implementing economic models on real datasets to generate actionable insights

The course follows a **"Concept Extension"** philosophy: master the statistical fundamentals, then leverage ML to handle complexity, dimensionality, and scale.
