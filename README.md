"Hi! I am an economics student building a digital portfolio for my course ECON 3916: Statistical & Machine Learning for Economics.

I need you to help me write a professional README.md file for the main page of my GitHub repository.

**About Me:**
* I am an undergraduate student looking for roles in [Insert: Data Analysis / Economic Consulting / Finance].
* I want this profile to show that I can bridge the gap between traditional economic theory and modern data science.

**About This Repository:**
* This repository hosts my coursework and labs.
* The Course Philosophy: We use a 'Concept Extension' approach, where we take foundational statistical concepts (like regression) and scale them up using Machine Learning algorithms (like Lasso).
* Tools I am using: Python, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, Google Colab, and Statsmodels.

**What I need you to do:**
Please write a professional, welcoming introduction for this repository. It should have:
1. A catchy title (e.g., 'Economic Data Science Portfolio').
2. A section called 'About this Portfolio' that explains I am learning to combine causal inference with predictive analytics.
3. A 'Tech Stack' section listing the tools above with nice icons if possible.

Keep the tone professional but eager to learn."
